 * This macro helps read or write a fixed-sized integer as part of a serde function.
 * Depending on the writing flag, we either read or write a field by delegating to
 * aws_byte_cursor_[read/write]_[suffix].
 *
 * Note that fieldptr does not need to be of type 'type'. This helps in cases where
 * the underlying field we want to write (in memory) is of one type but the serialized
 * type depends on the frame type (e.g. the body size field is a different size for
 * non-framed bodies and final frames). We use a temporary variable to perform integer
 * up/downconversion in this case.
 *
 * It's also worth noting that we do not bail out of the underlying function. This is
 * because we want to get the best estimate of the ciphertext size we can; if we have
 * insufficient data, we continue counting up fields beyond the end of the buffer (but
 * don't actually read or write beyond the end of the buffer, thanks to the byte cursor
 * macros).
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   type - the type of the field to write/read
 *   suffix - the suffix of aws_byte_cursor_[read/write]_* to use
 *   state - a pointer to a framestate structure. This pointer may be evaluated multiple
 *           times.
 *   fieldptr - a pointer to an integer field that will contain/receive the value to write/read.
 *              This does not need to be of type 'type'.
