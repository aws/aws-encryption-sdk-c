 * recommend using a service such as AWS KMS or a secure device such as a
 * hardware security module (HSM) that does not expose wrapping keys and
 * performs data key encryption within a secure boundary. However, if you
 * have a use case for doing encryption using local wrapping keys, the raw
 * AES keyring will do AES-GCM encryption of data keys with the AES-128,
 * AES-192, or AES-256 wrapping key that you provide.
 *
 * The raw AES keyring does the equivalent encryption and decryption as the
 * AWS Encryption SDK for Java's JceMasterKey when used with a secret key
 * and the AWS Encryption SDK for Python's RawMasterKey when used in
 * symmetric mode. Data encrypted by any of the SDKs can be decrypted by
 * any of the others using the same wrapping key.
