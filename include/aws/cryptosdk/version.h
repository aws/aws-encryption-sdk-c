/*! \mainpage The AWS Encryption SDK for C
 *
 * The AWS Encryption SDK for C is a client-side encryption library designed to make it easy for
 * everyone to encrypt and decrypt data using industry standards and best practices. It uses a
 * data format compatible with the AWS Encryption SDKs in other languages. For more information on
 * the AWS Encryption SDKs in all languages, see the
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html">Developer Guide</a>.
 *
 * <b>This library is currently in public preview.</b>
 * Feel free to check out the code and give it a spin, but be aware that the APIs are still in flux.
 * We'd love to hear your feedback on the APIs before they're fully nailed down.
 *
 * Source code and installation instructions are available in
 * <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-c">the GitHub repository</a>.

/**
 * @defgroup versioning Version constants
 *
 * This section defines version macros that can be used to query the current version of the Encryption SDK.
 * For prerelease builds, the version constants will generally contain the anticipated version of the upcoming
 * release; if a git working copy is detected at build time, we will include that revision in the version
 * strings, but not in the numeric version constants.
