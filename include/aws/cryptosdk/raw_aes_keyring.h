/**
 * A Keyring (KR) which does local AES-GCM encryption and decryption of data keys using
 * the bytes in the array provided as the AES key.
 *
 * Master key ID, provider ID and raw key bytes provided by the caller are copied into
 * the state of the KR, so those arrays do not need to be maintained while using the KR.
 * For maximum security, the caller should zero out the array of raw key bytes after
 * creating this object.
 *
 * The encryption context which is passed to this KR on encrypt and decrypt calls is
 * used as additional authenticated data (AAD) in the AES-GCM encryption of the data keys.
 * This means that the same encryption context must be present for both encryption and
 * decryption. The master key ID and provider ID are solely used to determine which master
 * key to use, so if they do not match, this KR will not find the encrypted data key to
 * decrypt. In other words, a raw AES KR which attempts to decrypt data previously
 * encrypted by another raw AES KR must have the same master key ID and provider ID.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
