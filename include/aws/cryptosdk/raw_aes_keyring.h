/**
 * A keyring which does local AES-GCM encryption and decryption of data keys using
 * the bytes in the array provided as the wrapping key.
 *
 * Key namespace, name, and raw key bytes provided by the caller are copied into
 * the state of the KR, so those arrays do not need to be maintained while using
 * the KR. For maximum security, the caller should zero out the array of raw key
 * bytes after creating this object.
 *
 * The encryption context which is passed to this KR on encrypt and decrypt calls
 * is used as additional authenticated data (AAD) in the AES-GCM encryption of the
 * data keys. This means that the same encryption context must be present for both
 * encryption and decryption.
 *
 * Set your own namespace and name for the wrapping key you use, for bookkeeping
 * purposes. A raw AES keyring which attempts to decrypt data previously encrypted
 * by another raw AES keyring must specify the same name and namespace.
 *
 * Note: when this keyring is used, it generates a trace that includes copies of
 * the namespace and name strings for each call. If you generate either or both of
 * the namespace and name strings using the AWS_STATIC_STRING_FROM_LITERAL macro,
 * all copies of these strings will be optimized out.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
