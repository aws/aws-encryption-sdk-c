/**
 * @defgroup session Session APIs
 * The session is the primary API that encrypts or decrypts your data.
 * To encrypt or decrypt data, configure your CMM, create a session object,
 * and process your plaintext or ciphertext through this session object.
 *
 * Typically using a session object will proceed through the following phases:
 *
 * 1. Create and configure a session object (or reuse an existing session that you have
 *    reset and configured)
 * 2. Invoke @ref aws_cryptosdk_session_process in a loop that provide all of the input
 *    plaintext or ciphertext, and produces some output data
 * 3. When encrypting, after all input data is consumed,
 *    @ref aws_cryptosdk_session_set_message_size (if it hasn't been called already) to
 *    mark the end of the message.
 * 4. To process or generate trailing data, invoke @ref aws_cryptosdk_session_process in
 *    a loop with no input data until @ref aws_cryptosdk_session_is_done returns true.
 *
 * Most configuration functions will fail if invoked after the first call to @ref aws_cryptosdk_session_process,
 * as the header is generated (thus committing the session to a particular set of parameters)
 * at this time.
 *
 * The session object does not internally buffer your data; if you pass buffers that are too
 * small, it may process only a portion of the supplied data, or none at all. The @ref
 * aws_cryptosdk_session_estimate_buf function can be used to get a more accurate estimate
 * of the amount of buffer space required to make further progress.
