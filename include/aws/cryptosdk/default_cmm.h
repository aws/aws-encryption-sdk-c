/**
 * @ingroup cmm_kr_highlevel
 * Instantiate the default (non-caching) implementation of the Crypto Materials
 * Manager (CMM). A Keyring must have already been instantiated and a pointer
 * to it passed in. This CMM implements all of the CMM virtual functions.
 *
 * On each call to Generate Encryption Materials, it makes a call to the
 * keyring's On Encrypt function to generate and encrypt a data key. If an
 * algorithm suite that does not include signing is used, this is the only
 * thing that the Generate Encryption Materials does. If an algorithm suite
 * that does include signing is used, then the call additionally begins the
 * calculation of the trailing signature, which will be completed by the
 * session.
 *
 * On each call to Decrypt Materials, it passes the full list of EDKs to the
 * keyring and asks it to find one to decrypt, via the keyring's On Decrypt
 * function. If an algorithm suite that does not include signing is used, this
 * is the only thing that the Decrypt Materials call does. If an algorithm
 * suite that does include signing is used, then the call additionally begins
 * the verification of the trailing signature, which will be completed by the
 * session.
 *
 * If a CMM that delegates to the default CMM selects an algorithm suite, that
 * algorithm suite will be used. Otherwise, the default CMM will select a default
 * algorithm suite. This is initially ALG_AES256_GCM_IV12_TAG16_HKDF_SHA384_ECDSA_P384,
 * but can be overridden using aws_cryptosdk_default_cmm_set_alg_id.
 *
 * On success allocates a CMM and returns a pointer to it. Be sure to call
 * aws_cryptosdk_cmm_release when you are done using the pointer so that the
 * memory is properly deallocated.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
