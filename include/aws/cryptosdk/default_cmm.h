/**
 * Instantiate the default (non-caching) implementation of the Crypto Materials
 * Manager (CMM). A Keyring (KR) must have already been instantiated
 * and a pointer to it passed in. This CMM maintains no state of its own other
 * than pointers to the KR and allocator. It implements all of the CMM virtual
 * functions.
 *
 * On each attempt to generate encryption materials, it asks the KR to generate a
 * data key.
 *
 * On each attempt to decrypt materials, it passes the full list of EDKs to the KR
 * and asks it to find one to decrypt.
 *
 * If a CMM that delegates to the default CMM selects an algorithm suite, that algorithm
 * suite will be used. Otherwise, the default CMM will select a default algorithm suite.
 * This is initially AES_128_GCM_IV12_AUTH16_KDSHA256_SIGNONE, but can be overridden using
 * aws_cryptosdk_default_cmm_set_alg_id.
 *
 * On success allocates a CMM and returns its address. Be sure to deallocate it later
 * by calling aws_cryptosdk_cmm_destroy on the CMM pointer returned by this function.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
