 * @defgroup enc_ctx Encryption Context utilities

 * The encryption context is a string-to-string map of contextual information
 * that is cryptographically bound to the message. We represent the encryption
 * context as an aws_hash_table mapping from aws_string * to aws_string *;
 * for the most part, aws_hash_table methods are used to manipulate these structures,
 * but we provide some higher-level helper methods in this section. These helpers
 * will mostly be of interest to developers of custom CMMs or keyrings.
