/**
 * When a keyring is called it produces a trace of what actions it took with the
 * different wrapping keys it manages. The trace is a list of these records.
 *
 * The flags argument uses bit flags to indicate which actions were taken.
 *
 * The other arguments are identifiers which indicate which wrapping key was used
 * to do data key encryption by a keyring. Most keyring implementations write
 * the wrapping_key_namespace into the provider ID field of EDKs and the
 * wrapping_key_name into the provider info field of EDKs, and all new keyring
 * implementations should follow this practice. For legacy reasons, the raw AES
 * keyring includes other data in the provider ID field, but only the first part
 * of that field corresponds to what is stored in the name field here.
 *
 * Note: "Master Key (MK)" is used as a class name in the Java and Python
 * implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK, where it is an abstraction of a
 * single wrapping key, and "Master Key Provider (MKP)" is a class that provides
 * multiple wrapping keys. In the AWS Encryption SDK for C, the keyring
 * replaces both of these concepts. It handles one or multiple wrapping keys,
 * which makes it similar to an MKP, but from an API perspective it is in some
 * ways closer to an MK. In order to avoid confusion with the MK class of the
 * Java and Python SDKs, we always refer to a single entity used by a keyring
 * for data key encryption as a wrapping key.
 *
 * The motivating example of a wrapping key is a KMS CMK, for which the
 * namespace is "aws-kms" and the name is the key ARN.
