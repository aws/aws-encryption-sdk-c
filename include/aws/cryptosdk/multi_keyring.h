/**
 * Creates a new multi-keyring. This keyring allows you to combine keyrings into
 * a single keyring. When used for encryption, the resulting document can be 
 * decrypted by any of the included keyrings. When used for decryption, the multi-
 * keyring will attempt to decrypt using each of the included keyrings.
 *
 * A generator keyring is needed for calls to generate data key, but not for calls
 * to encrypt data key and decrypt data key. It can be set as the second argument
 * of this function, or caller may make that argument NULL to not set a generator.
 * It can later be set by calling aws_cryptosdk_multi_keyring_set_generator.
 * Attempting to call generate data key on a multi-keyring without a generator
 * will result in it failing with a AWS_CRYPTOSDK_ERR_BAD_STATE error code. For
 * calls to encrypt data key and decrypt data key, the generator keyring is treated
 * as just another child keyring.
 *
 * Initially the multi keyring has no included child keyrings. If it also has no
 * generator keyring, encrypt and decrypt calls will trivially succeed without
 * actually encrypting or decrypting data keys.
 *
 * On generate data key calls, this will generate the data key with the generator
 * keyring, which generally also puts an EDK on the list. It will then attempt to
 * encrypt the data key with each child keyring that was added. On an error from
 * the generator or any child keyring, AWS_OP_ERR will be returned, and no data key
 * or EDKs will be added to the encryption materials. The generator or child keyring
 * that had the error is expected to set the error code.
 *
 * Encrypt data key calls are similar, except that encrypt is called on every child
 * keyring, and the generator, if one is set.
 *
 * Decrypt data key will attempt to decrypt one of the EDKs with each child keyring,
 * and the generator (if one is set) until it succeeds. Errors from child keyrings
 * will not stop it from proceeding to others. If it succeeds in decrypting an EDK,
 * it will return AWS_OP_SUCCESS, even if one or more of the child keyrings failed.
 * If it does not succeed in decrypting an EDK, it will return AWS_OP_SUCCESS if
 * there were no errors, and AWS_OP_ERR if there were errors. As with all decrypt
 * data key calls, check decryption materials unencrypted_data_key.buffer to see
 * whether an EDK was decrypted.
 *
 * Destroying this keyring will NOT destroy the keyrings that were added to it. Be
 * sure to call the destructors on those keyrings too in order to avoid memory leaks.
