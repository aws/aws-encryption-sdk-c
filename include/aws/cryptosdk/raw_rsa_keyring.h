/**
 * A Keyring (KR) which does local RSA encryption and decryption of data keys using
 * the RSA key provided as a string in PEM format. 
 * 
 * In the case of encryption 'rsa_key_pem' is a string containing the private key 
 * in PEM format and in the case of decryption 'rsa_key_pem' is a string containing 
 * the public key in PEM format. Note that rsa_key_pem is expected to be a null
 * terminated C-string for determining its length.  
 *
 * Master key ID, provider ID and the RSA key provided by the caller are copied into
 * the state of the KR, so those arrays do not need to be maintained while using the KR.
 * For maximum security, the caller should zero out the array of rsa_key_pem after 
 * creating this object.
 *
 * The master key ID and provider ID are solely used to determine which master
 * key to use, so if they do not match, this KR will not find the encrypted data key 
 * to decrypt. In other words, a raw RSA KR which attempts to decrypt data previously
 * encrypted by another raw RSA KR must have the same master key ID and provider ID.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
