/**
 * A Keyring (KR) which does local RSA encryption and decryption of data keys using
 * the RSA keys provided as a null terminated C-string in PEM format.
 *
 * Here, 'rsa_public_key_pem' is a null terminated C-string containing the public key 
 * in PEM format and 'rsa_private_key_pem' is a null terminated C-string containing the
 * private key in PEM format. Note that either argument may be set to NULL. Encryption 
 * is possible only when a public key is provided, and decryption is possible only when 
 * a private key is provided. 
 * 
 * Master key ID, provider ID, RSA private key and RSA public key provided by the
 * caller are copied into the state of the KR, so those arrays do not need to be
 * maintained while using the KR. For maximum security, the caller should zero out the
 * arrays of 'rsa_private_key_pem' after creating this object.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
