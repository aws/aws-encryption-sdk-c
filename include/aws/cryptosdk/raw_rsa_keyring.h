/**
 * A keyring which does local RSA encryption and decryption of data keys using
 * the RSA keys provided as a null terminated C-string in PEM format.
 *
 * Here, 'rsa_public_key_pem' is a null terminated C-string containing the public
 * key in PEM format and 'rsa_private_key_pem' is a null terminated C-string
 * containing the private key in PEM format. Note that either argument may be set
 * to NULL. Encryption is possible only when a public key is provided, and
 * decryption is possible only when a private key is provided. 
 * 
 * Key namespace, name, RSA private key and RSA public key provided by the caller
 * are copied into the state of the keyring, so those arrays do not need to be
 * maintained while using the keyring. For maximum security, the caller should
 * zero out the array of 'rsa_private_key_pem' after creating this object.
 *
 * Set your own namespace and name for the wrapping (RSA) key you use, for
 * bookkeeping purposes. A raw RSA keyring which attempts to decrypt data
 * previously encrypted by another raw RSA keyring must specify the same name
 * and namespace.
 *
 * Note: when this keyring is used, it generates a trace that includes copies of
 * the namespace and name strings for each call. If you generate either or both of
 * the namespace and name strings using the AWS_STATIC_STRING_FROM_LITERAL macro,
 * all copies of these strings will be optimized out.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets an internal AWS error code.
