      # a regression that causes aws-sdk-cpp and aws-encryption-sdk-c to fail
      # to build on the runners.
      # This appears to have been an issue in CMake that is fixed in 3.19.3.
      # This workaround is required until the MacOS Action is updated to a
      # a newer CMake, or the dependency adds a workaround for 3.19.1.
