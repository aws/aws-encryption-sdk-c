 * This test keyring was used as a generic mock of a keyring for the multi keyring
 * tests. Moving it into tests/lib so that it can be used in other keyring tests.
 * For the moment, we are just moving relevant pieces here and exposing the innards
 * entirely through the header file so as not to make breaking changes the multi
 * keyring tests. We may eventually want to build a cleaner interface to this code.
