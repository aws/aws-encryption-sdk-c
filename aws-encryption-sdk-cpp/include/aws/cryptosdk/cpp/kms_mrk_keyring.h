 *
 * Because there is no pure-C AWS KMS client at the moment, C++ is required to
 * use this keyring. We expect that a parallel pure-C API will be added in the

 * class before calling Build, and once the keyring is built, its configuration
 * cannot be changed.

 * After the keyring is constructed, the only ways you should interact with the
