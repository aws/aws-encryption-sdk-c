/**
 * @defgroup kms_keyring KMS keyring (AWS SDK for C++)
 *
 * We have implemented a keyring on top of KMS, which uses the AWS SDK for C++
 * as its underlying KMS client.  This is compatible with the Java and Python
 * KMSMasterKeyProvider.
 *
 * Because there is no pure-C AWS KMS client at the moment, C++ is required to
 * use this keyring. We expect that a parallel pure-C API will be added in the
 * future when a pure-C KMS client becomes available.

/**
 * Helper class for building a new KmsKeyring object. You cannot construct a KmsKeyring directly
 * and must use this class instead. This class is the only API you need to interact with KmsKeyrings.
 * You will set all of the configuration of the KmsKeyring with this class before calling Build, and
 * once the keyring is built, its configuration cannot be changed.

 * After the KmsKeyring is constructed, the only ways you should interact with the
 * (aws_cryptosdk_keyring *) are to pass it to a CMM or another keyring (such as the multi-keyring)
 * and to release the pointer with aws_cryptosdk_keyring_release.
 *
 * For general documentation about keyrings see include/aws/cryptosdk/materials.h. This header will
 * only document what is specific to the KmsKeyring.

     * You must specify at least one KMS CMK to use as a master key for encryption and decryption

     * decryption attempts, and it is the only key for which you need to have KMS GenerateDataKey
     * permissions in order to do encryption.
     *
     * If this keyring is called for encryption after another keyring has already generated the
     * data key (for example, in a multi-keyring) then the generator CMK will encrypt an existing
     * data key. In that case, you will need KMS Encrypt permissions on this CMK.
     *
     * Optionally, you may specify a list of additional CMKs to encrypt the data key with.
     * Encrypting with multiple CMKs gives users who have KMS Decrypt access with *any one*
     * of those CMKs the ability to decrypt the data. For encryption you will only need KMS Encrypt
     * permission on the additional CMKs. You will NEVER need KMS GenerateDataKey permission on them.
     *
     * Providing multiple CMKs for decryption allows the decryption of data that was encrypted using
     * any of those keys. You will need KMS Decrypt permission on the generator CMK and all other CMKs.
     *
     * Key IDs for encryption may be specified in two different ways:
     *
     * (1) key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:999999999999:key/01234567-89ab-cdef-fedc-ba9876543210
     * (2) alias ARN:  arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:999999999999:alias/MyCryptoKey
     *
     * Key IDs for decryption must be specified as key ARNs only, i.e., format (1) above. Format
     * (2) will not work for decryption. The AWS Encryption SDK will allow you to attempt decrypts
     * with a KmsKeyring configured with keys in format (2) without errors, but it will only succeed
     * in decrypting data that was encrypted with keys that were specified in key ARN format. This
     * is a limitation of the message format of encryption and of the KMS APIs, not of this library.
