         * KmsKeyrings for each default region, and join them together with a multi-keyring.

         * (2) through (4) will not work for decryption. The AWS Encryption SDK will allow you to attempt
         * decrypts with a KmsKeyring configured with keys in formats (2) through (4) without errors, but
         * it will only succeed in decrypting data that was encrypted with keys that were specified in
