# We're going to install our own version of openssl at /deps/install/lib - this lets us test against multiple openssl versions.
# However, this also means we need to install our own version of curl, as curl links against libssl and the C++ SDK links
# against curl. What's more, we can't remove system libcurl, as we'd need to build and install our own version of git if we
# did so. Sigh.
#
# To deal with this mess, set up a bunch of -rpath overrides to ensure that all the binaries we build look in a different
# library directory first. We do this setup after configuring cmake, as we don't particularly need/want cmake to depend
# on our special versions of openssl/libcurl (or to depend on them at all for that matter).
